            <p>The front-end is everything involved with what the user sees, including the webpage design and languages such as HTML and CSS. A front-end developer can create a website without using back-end, however this site would be a static site. Statics sites will almost always stay the same, unless they redesign it or update it. Also this sites dont require information to be stored in databases. This type of sites are useful for simple purposes such as restaurants and other small business. </p>

            <h2 class="display-4">Backend</h2>
            <p>The back-end, or the "server-side", is basically everything that is behind the design of the website, basically its how the site works, updates and changes. This refers to everything the user can't see in the browser, like databases and servers. Usually people who work on the back-end are called programmers or developers. Back-end developers are mostly worried about things like security, structure and content management. Back-end developers, or at least back-end development, is required to create a dynamic site. A dynamic site is a site that's constantly changing and updated in real-time. Most sites are dynamic sites, as opposed to static sites.</p>

            <p>A content delivery network or content distribution network (CDN) is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their data centers. The goal is to provide high availability and high performance by distributing the service spatially relative to end-users. Meaning that there would be servers around the world and youll be accessing to the closest one.</p>

            <p>HTML was originally developed by a man named Tim Berners-Lee while at CERN. While working at CERN, he became frustrated at having to log on to different computers to find different information and thought that there must be a better way. He figured that there must be a way to hop from one set of information to another thats on different computers. This concept of a hyper-text system would go on to form the basis for the fundamental language of the world wide web HTML. The first ever version of HTML was released aroun 1990 HTML 1.0. And it allowed you to get some simple text up on the web by using one of thier 22 tags. As time continued tags where added to html, releasing versions up to the last one which would be html5.</p>
            <p>CSS was first proposed by Hakon Wium Lie on October 10, 1994. At the time, Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation (CSS1) being released in 1996. As HTML grew, it came to encompass a wider variety of stylistic capabilities to meet the demands of web developers. This evolution gave the designer more control over site appearance, at the cost of more complex HTML.</p>
